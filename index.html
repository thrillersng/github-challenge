<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Idowu Damilola Miracle. I am a recent graduate of the department of computer engineering from the 
    university of lagos. I am passionate about tech, i see it as the major tool that can put Africa and especially Nigeria on the world map.
    Apart from my love for tech, i am also very crazy about music. I hope to do something in music someday, maybe release my own songs independently.
    I am in between the process of finding where i truly belong in tech, as i have developed interests for software development, data science and networking.
</p>

<p>My goal as a developer for the next two years is basically being on top of my game in the field, building products that are scalable for
    the next billion users and also being in a position to mentor others to become world class developers as i hope to be myself. </p>
